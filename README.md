# Time Chimp Extended
A Zapier integration to add an extra trigger for the [Time Chimp application](https://www.timechimp.com/ )

## Trigger
___
**Completed Time Entry**

The current Time Chimp app only has a trigger for when a new time entry is started, which is before there will be  a duration or the clockout time. This will only trigger when a time entry is completed so you will have access to both.
